a basic web application that generates a simple and minimalistic resume for viewing on larger screens. Additionally, for mobile devices, I built and designed a portfolio using Next.js and deployed it on Vercel.

# Getting Started Locally

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ysahih/Portfolio.git
   ```

2. Move to the cloned directory

   ```bash
   cd Portfolio
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the local Server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The minimalist CV for larger screens showcases a clean and simple design that highlights key information effectively. The mobile portfolio, on the other hand, is optimized for smaller screens and offers a user-friendly experience. Feel free to explore both versions by following the steps above.
